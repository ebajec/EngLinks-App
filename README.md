# englinks-app

Prototype mobile app for EngLinks, built with Flutter.  The main purpose of this is to allow students to match with tutors, along with a few other features.
Currently, there is an event calendar, a small settings page, and the ability for users to send/view tutor requests.  This is more of a proof-of-concept, as opposed to a fully functioning app.

**Setup:** Requires working Flutter installation to build.  To use all features, an instance of the [EngLinks-App-Server](https://github.com/ebajec/EngLinks-App-Server) must be running on the same network. The server URL can be specified within the app while running, set to 'localhost' by default. 

**Login:** A connection to the server is currently required to login, but any input will give a valid login.
