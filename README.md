# EngLinks-App

Prototype mobile app for EngLinks.  The main purpose of this is to allow students to match with tutors, along with a few other features.
Currently, there is an event calendar, a small settings page, and the ability for users to send/view tutor requests. 

Requires working Flutter installation to run, along with an instance of the [server](https://github.com/ebajec/EngLinks-App-Server) running on the same network.
While not techincally required, most features will not do much without a connection to the server.
