# EngLinks-App

Prototype mobile app for EngLinks.  The main purpose of this is to allow students to match with tutors, along with a few other features.
Currently, there is an event calendar, a small settings page, and the ability for users to send/view tutor requests.  This is supposed to be more of a proof-of-concept over a functioning app.

**Setup:** Requires working Flutter installation to build.  To use all features, an instance of the [server](https://github.com/ebajec/EngLinks-App-Server) must be running on the same network. The server URL can be specified within the app while running, set to 'localhost' by default.  While not techincally required, most features will not do much without a connection to the server.

**Login:** A connection to the server is currently required to login, but any input will give a valid login.
